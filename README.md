# Neural-Architecture-Search
This is a re-implementation of the first neural architecture search paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578. 

We test our implementation on three setting: 
1. customized toy environment, where the dataset is a multi-modal Gaussian;
2. A 3-layer fully-connected network on Google speech commands dataset;
3. A simple CNN on Google speech commands dataset.


To run the code, simply go to the toy-model folder and run 

python pg.py

Instructions on how to run the google speech commands dataset will be updated soon. Please take a look on our report.
